### Usage:
```java
class Example {
    public void loadCoordinates(InputStream kofStream) throws IOException {
        KOFProcessor kofProcessor = KOFProcessor.readFrom(
                kofStream, 
                CoordinateSystem.EPSG_25832
        );

        List<CoordinatePoint> wsg84Coordinates = kofProcessor.getCoordinates(
                CoordinateSystem.EPSG_4326
        );
